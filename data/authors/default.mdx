I'm Ed

I'm a technology executive, consultant, strategist, and writer with a proven track record of guiding high-performing organizations through growth, transformation, and innovation. I've worked for industry leaders like Amazon, Oracle, PTC, and ThoughtWorks, helping startups scale, enabling enterprise reinvention, and building platforms that drive billions in value. But what fuels me most is aligning people with purpose to create a meaningful, lasting impact that delights the team and users.

My leadership style is rooted in adaptability and intent. I tailor my approach to meet teams where they are, whether driving clarity in ambiguity, scaling complex systems, or unlocking individual potential. I lead with empathy, candor, and a deep belief in the power of shared vision. I've been known to tell my direct reports, "While you report to me, I work for you."

I specialize in the intersection of innovation and impact, including AI, data, distributed systems, and platforms. I'm constantly seeking the edge of what's possible, not for novelty's sake but to deliver meaningful change in the businesses I serve.

Equally, I'm passionate about helping organizations see around corners. I bring a strategic lens to every problem, identifying leverage points, crafting durable plans, and guiding transformation that sticks. My goal isn't to ride the wave of the macroenvironment but to generate momentum.

Lifelong learning shapes everything I do. I hold several graduate degrees in business and technology. Sharing knowledge, whether mentoring leaders or teaching aspiring technologists, is one of the most meaningful forms of impact.

Outside of work, I'm a proud husband and father, a solo guitarist and composer, a fight science enthusiast, and a recovering perfectionist who chases balance, growth, and joy wherever I can find them.

My mission is to help others, bringing happiness along the way where we can find it.
