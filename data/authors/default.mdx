Hi, I’m Ed!
I’m a technologist and business leader with more than two decades of experience working across software, AI, data, and
complex technology systems. Along the way, I’ve spent time at Amazon, Oracle, PTC, and Thoughtworks. But the real story
isn’t the logos. It’s the people, the challenges, and the possibilities that have made the journey meaningful.

My leadership style is situational, flexible and adaptive. I meet teams where they are, sometimes taking a more
coach-oriented directive approach and sometimes a more supportive one, always with the goal of helping people grow and
succeed. This way of working has consistently improved team performance while giving individuals the space to discover
and expand their own potential.

My playground is the frontier of innovation. I spend my time exploring code, math, business, and the patterns that
connect them. I’m always looking for ways to push boundaries and reimagine what is possible. I don’t just want to feel
the wind of change. I want to be out there creating it.

I care just as much about impact as I do about technology. I support nonprofit and charitable initiatives in
sustainability, education, literacy, digital inclusion, transparency, and economic fairness. To me, innovation should
be something that expands access, not something that builds barriers.

Learning has always been at the center of my life. My academic path has included a BA in music and mathematics, an MBA
 specialized in strategy, finance, and analytics, and towards an MSc in computer science with a focus on distributed systems,
 AI, and ML. Just as rewarding as learning is sharing what I learn through teaching, coaching, and mentoring.
 I’m lucky to share that love for education with my wife, who is the bravest of souls and a teacher of eighth-grade math.

Outside of work, I’m a father, brother, uncle, musician, fitness enthusiast, beagle herder, and student of the fight
sciences. These aren’t side notes. They bring balance, energy, and perspective to everything I do.

I hope you’ll enjoy this adventure with me.
