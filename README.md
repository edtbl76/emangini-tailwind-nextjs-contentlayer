# emangini-tailwind-nextjs-contentlayer

## Overview

This project is a modern web application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Contentlayer. It combines the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, the flexibility of Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, and the content management capabilities of Contentlayer. The goal is to reuse this scalable and efficient framework for developing fast, responsive, and content-rich web applications to get my content out quickly!
